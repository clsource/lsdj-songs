CLSource's LSDJ Songs
==========

Just Songs that I made using [LSDJ](http://littlesounddj.com/).

Use [LSDManager](https://code.google.com/p/lsdmanager/) to edit your sav and play the songs in lsdj.

Most songs were made using a red [DMG 01](http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Boy) with a [USB SmartCard](http://store.kitsch-bent.com/product/usb-64m-smart-card), but if you need an emulator I recommend [Gambatte](https://github.com/sinamas/gambatte).

### Note
Some songs have "junk" that I forgot to delete, don't worry. listen to the recording
in my [Soundcloud](http://www.soundcloud.com/clsource)
and search for the correct patterns.
